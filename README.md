# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - 3.0.0
* Without Docker command for install and run dependencies (MacOS): `brew install rabbitmq`, `brew services start rabbitmq`, install MongoDB, `brew services start mongodb-community`
* Run commands by project: `bundle install`
* Run workers: for example, `rake worker:start_analytics_worker`
* `rails s`
